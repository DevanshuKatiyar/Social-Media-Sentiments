# Sentiment Analysis Project README

## Overview:

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project, where we delve into public sentiments expressed through comments on a pivotal interview featuring Vladimir Putin and Tucker Carlson. This conversation unfolds against the backdrop of a tumultuous global economy and critical discourse surrounding Putin's maneuvers in Ukraine. With over 100,000 comments, our dataset reflects diverse global perspectives and serves as a mirror to the world's reaction to key international events discussed in the interview.

## Work Done:

### Data Mining:
- Removed unwanted unnecessary emojis and URLs from the dataset to ensure cleaner analysis and interpretation.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and patterns of reply counts and likes within the comments.
- Explored correlations between reply counts and likes to uncover potential insights into engagement levels.

### Linear Regression:
- Utilized linear regression to analyze relationships between variables and predict outcomes.
- Incorporated thresholds for likes and replies to identify potential instances of bullying within comments.
- Sent the dataset through linear regression models, achieving improved accuracy in prediction.

### Prediction:
- Employed sampling techniques to predict outcomes based on the trained linear regression models.

## Repository Structure:
